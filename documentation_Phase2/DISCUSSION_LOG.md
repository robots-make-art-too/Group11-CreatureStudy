### DOCUMENTATION LOG OF GROUP CONVERSATION ON 03/10/2022:
- Talked about what had been uploaded to the repo (see date: 03/10/2022).
- Talked about finishing up what was left of Phase 2 and who would be willing to do the rest of the work pertaining to that (**Yinkan + Yuanchen**):
    - Testing the live AR scene
    - Documentation of a successful test run
- Documented a group conversation that was mostly auditory / spoken through Discord VC, and partially texted via Discord text chat (**already done here! this is the file lol**)
- Designated group roles to people based on what they were willing to do (_placed in the appropiate section at the bottom_)

## GOALS MADE FROM RESULTING CONVERSATION (_pertaining to upcoming Phase 3_):
    - Considering a good number of us aren't really that strong coding-wise, we decided that sticking with marker-based AR (_for now_) would be the best - the designated members for coding/testing would schedule time with the professor to ask questions if further help was needed and could not be gotten from other group members.
    - Briefly mentioned implementation of information cards for the creatures/models being displayed (_though questions into how to integrate such functionality remains ongoing_).
    - Briefly mentioned overhaul of theme HTML + CSS.
    - Talking about making new models and how many more (_amount not finalized_), redoing older preliminary textures for those models, etc.

## Group Roles (_could always be changed in the future_):
- **Lilian:** Modelling / making varying graphics / CSS + HTML for website customization
- **Gianluca:** Coding/AR functionality
- **Lucas:** Tester / Documentation
- **Yinkan:**  Texturing / Modelling
- **Yuanchen:** Graphics / Helping to test / code sometimes

# Additional Notes:
- The first draft versionmodels + their textures, QR code, the custom markers + their .patt files, and the launching of gh-pages / the group site + preliminary code upkeep (**up until 03/10/2022 at 6:30pm**) was all managed and created / acquired by Lilian. For the rest of Phase 2, the remaining group members were responsible for testing the site and documenting a successful run via a short video uploaded to this folder / via a link.

- Images of the rendered models have been placed in this folder as well.
