# 2. Who will have write access to merge Github branches, pull requests, and content updates? Will it be one, two, or all group members? Is no one comfortable enough to do so?

> Yinkan, Lilian

# 3. Make a private repo, give all members access.

[X] This has been done already.

# 4. Create a branch in your group repo - one for each student. These will be "working copies", or "dev branches". There should be ONE of the main, base, or primary branch - and then additional branches for each member of the group. Name the branches dev-student name (first name only or last name only is also fine).

[X] The branch "dev-Lilian" exists.
[] The branch "dev-Lucas" exists.
[X] The branch "dev-Yinkan" exists.
[] The branch "dev-Gianluca" exists.
[] The branch "dev-Yuanchen" exists.

# 5. Submit this document to the main branch.

[] Done.

# 6. Everyone has cloned a local copy once all the above steps have been completed.

[] Done.

Remember this - put it on your computer screen if you have to:
> Git Status -> Git Fetch -> Git Pull -> Git add -> Git commit -> Git push
> Please remember to fetch and pull first so you are always working with an up to date copy of the remote repo!

# Here is how you will practice and test #6 :

    > Create a new file in your main branch called resources.md.
    > Each student is to GIT FETCH then GIT PULL the remote repo to obtain a copy of this file. []
    > Checkout/switch to your dev branch and GIT ADD the file. []
    > Each student is responsible for locating 10 resources. They can be:
        > links
        > books
        > code
        > existing works
        > people, places, things that inspire you
        > things you hate, things you love etc.

Each student will be responsible for 5 x technical resources and 5 x artistic/design/aesthetic resources.

Add the links to your local copy of the file resources.md.
Whenever a student is ready - fetch the remote repo, and then pull or create a pull request if you don't have write access.
Whoever has merge access - merge all the files back into one. THIS CANNOT BE COPY-PASTE; FOR GRADING PURPOSES, THE DIFFERENT COMMITS, PULL REQUESTS, ETC. HAVE TO BE VISIBLE.

Edit and combine the resources together - there should be about 40-50 resources total; 20-25 of each type.

[] The resources.md file should be located on the main branch along with this Group document.

# Finally, you are asked to document a discussion between group members regarding the technical and aesthetic initial thoughts - it would be best to read some of the provided context first as well as the expanded details of the project. A successful project must consider a larger context and concept - situating your technical output/work with critical thought is as important as the programming design.
